# What is this?
This bullet journal program allows you to add weekly events and tasks, 
view them in a mini viewer, see statistics about your week, and even set a 
password. It's a great way to get to write down any quotes and notes you have,
and plan your week in a visually appealing way! You can pick a template for a bullet
journal to get started, then easily use a menubar to navigate adding 
tasks and events to your week. You can customize your week by setting
limits on tasks and events, and choosing the week start day. Furthermore, 
you can save your bullet journal to a file, and view a convenient task queue 
of all tasks left to be complete. 
This bullet journal has all the features to support easy planning every week! 


A full list of features includes:

A week view, where you can see all seven days of a week and associated events and tasks.
A menu in Edit to add events and tasks to certain days, with names, descriptions, and whether a task 
is complete. 
A way for a user to set a maximum number of tasks and events that a user can add, and 
a commitment warning when a user goes over that number.
A way to save and create a bullet journal file from a menu, and persist info about the 
journal in the files. 
A task queue / sidebar on the side of the week view, showing a list of all the 
tasks and if they're complete. 
A menu bar containing different operations on the bullet journal, such as 
adding tasks and events, saving, changing the start day of the week. 
A section where a user can write quotes and notes and persist them in the file. 
A section to show a weekly overview and statistics about the week: number tasks 
and number events, and percent tasks complete. 
Mini viewers for tasks and events, that will open new windows and show 
info about tasks and events (they will pop up when a task or event is clicked).
A way to change the week start date: by clicking the left/right arrows above 
the first day of the week, you can change the day the week starts.
Clickable links in commitments. 
A 'visual flourish' for the appearance of the bullet journal.
